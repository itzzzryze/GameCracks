##  HOW TO USE AND INSTALL THE GAMES 


*I AIN'T READING ALLAT*

## step 1
So first off you go to the [Game list](GameList.md) and look for the game you want to install.

## step 2 
Now that you've found your game we need to copy & paste the "weird" text under the game name

## step 3
All the "weird" text aren't links if you though so , they are magnet links . In order to use them u will need a torrent software (no ad) I use [qbittorrent](https://www.fosshub.com/qBittorrent.html?dwl=qbittorrent_4.5.0_x64_setup.exe)
*download and setup qbittorrent before you move on*

## step 4  
Open qbittorrent (or your torrent software of choice) and go to "add an torrent link"![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74117745/213690167-384e7c77-35ad-418c-9816-0c9be1ce5e1d.png)

Here you are going to paste all the magnet links(of the games [Game list](GameList.md)) you wanted to install and press download

 <sub> you can only paste one link per line .</sub>

 ## step 5 
 depending on how many games you've chosen to download it'll open so many windows . (for me it was two so it opened two [lol]) 
 it might take a minute or two until you're game shows up on the right.Now select you're download folder and press ok


## Step 6 (almost done!)
Now you can see your games are downloading to the selected folder . *this might take while because the servers you're downloading from
aren't steam supreme super deluxe ultra servers . for me with about 6-11mb/s a 60gb game took me 3 hours . *

## Step 7 (last step)
Once your download is done you can open the zip file it downloaded . going from here there are 3 diffrent cases
- Case 1: the games are already installed => you just need to unzip and play.

- Case 2: you get the installation folder after installing => you simply install it and play 


- Case 3: you get .iso files (or .mds, .cue,...) after unzip => you need to mount them, install from the .exe file inside, then crack them and enjoy. You can see the instructions here for this step by step with picture
